pubsub_cli is a super handy Pub/Sub CLI which lets you publish / subscribe Pub/Sub message right away!

## Installation
### CLI
#### Homebrew
```
$ brew tap k-yomo/pubsub_cli
$ brew install pubsub_cli 
```

#### Go 
```
$ go install github.com/ndkav4/pubsub_cli
```

### Pub/Sub Emulator
- If you want to use pubsub_cli for Pub/Sub Emulator, make sure the emulator is running before executing commands.
```
$ gcloud beta emulators pubsub start --host-port=0.0.0.0:8085
```
 
## Usage

```
Usage:
  pubsub_cli [command]

Available Commands:
  help                Help about any command
  publish             publish Pub/Sub message
  subscribe           subscribe Pub/Sub topics
  create_topic        create Pub/Sub topic
  create_subscription create Pub/Sub subscription
  register_push       register Pub/Sub push endpoint
  connect             connect remote topics to local topics

Flags:
  -c, --cred-file string   gcp credential file path (You can also set 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS' to env variable)
      --help               help for pubsub_cli
  -h, --host string        emulator host (You can also set 'PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST' to env variable)
  -p, --project string     gcp project id (You can also set 'GCP_PROJECT_ID' to env variable)
```
â€» When both of --host and --cred-file are set, emulator host will be prioritised for safety purpose.

## Auth
You need to be authenticated to execute pubsub_cli commands for real GCP Project. Recommended ways are described below.

1. use your own credential by execution `gcloud auth application-default login`
2. use service account's credentials json by setting option `--cred-file` or env variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

For more detail and about the other ways to authenticate, please refer to [official doc](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#oauth-2.0-clients).

## Examples
### Publish
```
$ gcloud auth application-default login
$ pubsub_cli publish test_topic '{"key":"value"}' -a key=value -p your_gcp_project
```

- publish a message to the topic (create if not exist)
```
$ pubsub_cli publish new_topic '{"topic":"will be created"}' --create-if-not-exist -p your_gcp_project
```

### Subscribe
- subscribe topics
```
$ pubsub_cli subscribe test_topic another_topic -c credentials.json -p your_gcp_project
```

- subscribe all
```
$ pubsub_cli subscribe all -c credentials.json -p your_gcp_project
```

### Create topic
```
$ pubsub_cli create_topic topic_1 topic_2 --host=localhost:8085 -p emulator
```

### Create Subscription
```
$ pubsub_cli cs test_topic test_topic_sub --create-if-not-exist -h localhost:8085 -p emulator
```

### Register Push Endpoint
```
$ pubsub_cli register_push test_topic http://localhost:1323/subscribe -h localhost:8085 -p emulator
```

### Connects Remote Topic with Local Topic
`connect` command is useful to register push subscriptions with local endpoint for real topics on GCP.

- connect topics
```
$ pubsub_cli connect your_gcp_project topic1 topic2 -host localhost:8085 -p emulator
```

- connect all
```
$ pubsub_cli connect your_gcp_project all -h localhost:8085 -p emulator
```

## Note
- Created topics won't be deleted automatically. 
- Unused subscriptions will be deleted in 24 hours.
